# ESS590-AmbientNoise-Maochuan
This repository is for the course **ESS590D -Ambient Field Seismology**

scatenet_Axial.ipynb is the code for running the unsupervised machine learning ambient seismic field data for Axial Seamount during 2015 eruption

get_dvv_Axial.ipynb is the modified verison to use NoisePy to compute cross correlations and perform measurements of changes in seismic velocities at Axial Seamount
